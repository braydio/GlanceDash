# ðŸ“Š Pre Configged Dashboard

This repo contains the configuration files for a **self-hosted personal dashboard** using [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance), a lightweight startpage and monitoring tool.

It includes two main pages:
- **Startpage** (general tools and monitoring)
- **Finance** (custom finance visualizations and RSS feeds)

The goal is to have a **fast-loading, centralized homepage** to monitor services, manage bookmarks, visualize financial data, and stay up-to-date with curated feeds.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure Overview

### `glance.yml`
- Core configuration file for Glance.
- Defines:
  - `server.assets-path`: where custom static assets like CSS live.
  - `theme.custom-css-file`: path to your custom styles (`/assets/user.css`).
  - `pages`: imports two page definitions:
    - `startpage.yml`
    - `finance.yml`
-  
> **Note:**  
> The `finance.yml` page references **iframe widgets** that expect a running instance of **pyNance Dashroad** on `http://localhost:3353`.  
> If the pyNance server is **not** running, those iframe sections will appear **blank**.

---

### `startpage.yml`
- A simple **landing page** focusing on quick search, service monitoring, and bookmarks.

**Widgets:**
- `search`  
  - Standard search bar with autofocus.
- `monitor`
  - Monitors key services running on localhost (e.g., Jellyfin, Sonarr, qBittorrent).
- `bookmarks`
  - Grouped into:
    - **Systems** (launchpads, admin panels)
    - **Finance** (finance dashboards and banking links)
    - **Other** (OpenAI, GitHub, ChatGPT)

**Purpose:**  
Quickly access commonly used apps and systems, with real-time service availability at a glance.

---

## âš¡ Requirements
- [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) running on your machine or server
- (Optional) [pyNance Dashroad](https://github.com/your-username/pynance) if you want the financial iframes to display content.
- Basic Docker setup or local development environment for running supporting services (Jellyfin, Sonarr, etc.).

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1. Install and run Glance.
2. Point Glance to the `glance.yml` configuration file.
3. Make sure your services (e.g., Jellyfin, pyNance Dashroad) are running at the specified ports.
4. Optionally customize the bookmarks, RSS feeds, or services list.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Private IPs have been replaced with `http://localhost` so this repo is **safe for public sharing**.
- Some iframe sections (finance metrics) **depend on external services** â€” they won't load if the service is not running locally.
- Custom styles are referenced via `/assets/user.css`. Make sure you add or update that file if you want to modify the dashboard appearance.
